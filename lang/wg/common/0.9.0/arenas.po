"Two directions of attack are divided by a swamp. The eastern side is ideal "

msgid "02_malinovka/description"
msgstr ""
"Initial staging areas are separated by a wide open field, ideal for "
"artillery and defensive operations. Concealment and cover including woods, "
"hills, and farmhouses can be decisive. Attackers should consider flanking "
"maneuvers, but another option is a well-coordinated high-speed assault "
"across the field, which could either bring victory or a bloody loss."

"A labyrinth of streets and squares, impassable for artillery and tank "

msgid "05_prohorovka/description"
msgstr ""
"Generally open terrain featuring a large hill and a railway embankment. "

"A mixture of city blocks and wooded outskirts, bisected by railroad tracks. "
